# Hi, Iâ€™m **Michael Agarkov**, or just call me Maikl.

I am an individual, who works on his own personal programs on PascalABC.NET and Visual Basic .NET,
write my own EULA's for my software using templates,
make my own graphic designs for my own software,
and even build my own professional installers for them in InstallShield 12!

I already made lots of programs, like my Firewall! (which isn't publically available),
an [IDE with fullscreen mode, always on top mode, 6 different themes, lots of settings and even printing](https://github.com/MichaelAgarkov/StandalIDE),
even [my own installation builder](https://github.com/MichaelAgarkov/MicSetup)
and tons of programs which i made in the past, like MicChat, that I revived ([MicChat Revived](https://github.com/MichaelAgarkov/MicChatRevived)). I also made lots more programs in the past, too much for me to mention here.

[The version of PascalABC.NET I use](https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET) (PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050)

If you want to collab with me, you need to know PascalABC.NET or Visual Basic .NET very well.
