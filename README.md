Hi, Iâ€™m @MichaelAgarkov, or just call me Maikl.

I am an individual, who works on his own personal programs on PascalABC.NET,
write my own EULA's for my software using templates,
make my own graphic designs for my own software,
and even build my own professional installers for them in InstallShield 12!

I already made lots of programs, like my Firewall! (which isn't publically available),
an advanced notepad with fullscreen mode, always on top mode, 6 different themes, lots of settings and even printing! (which also isn't publically available),
and tons of programs which i made in the past, like MicChat (made in April 2020), where you can host a server, and connect to it throught different systems, that are connected locally through the same WiFi, and have a nice chat! (which has lots of bugs), and lots more, too much for me to mention here.

If you want to collab with me, you need to know PascalABC.NET very well.
